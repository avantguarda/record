## Acknowledgements
Every great tool has a story. Ours begins with `watson` time tracker, created by [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/). It was a powerful, elegant solution that many of us came to rely on.

After nearly three years of inactivity on the [original project](https://github.com/jazzband/Watson/), we wanted to ensure its legacy would not only survive but thrive. Record was created to carry the torch forward.

As a direct fork, `rec` builds upon the brilliant foundation of `watson`. Our goal is to provide the active maintenance, modern enhancements, and long-term support this project deserves. We are deeply grateful to the original contributors for building something worth preserving.
